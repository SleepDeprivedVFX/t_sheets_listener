This is primarily for processing the UI for the overtime pop up.
It should do several things:
1. Pop-up alert when a user is about to go into overtime
2. Off up an overtime form.
3. Pop-Up alert when a user hits overtime.
4. Annoy the shit out of someone until they clock out once they're in overtime.  Unless the OT was approved.
    a. This may require another custom field to be added to Shotgun.  i.e. Overtime Approved Checkbox
