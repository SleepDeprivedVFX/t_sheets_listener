This utility is an early stage bridge designed to get data from the Time Lord and Shotgun Systems
and save it to an Excel Spreadsheet.  It is a temporary system which will eventually be replaced by
a possible NIM connection (for ASC) and possibly a direct connection to PayChex.  We'll see how it
goes.
